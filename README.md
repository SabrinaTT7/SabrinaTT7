Hi, I'm Sabrina! 

I am a front-end software engineer at HubSpot, and a recent gradaute from Middlebury College. 

I love all things computer science, and completed an honors thesis in computer graphics, which deals with voronoi diagrams. 

Check out my [personal website](https://sabrinatt7.github.io/personal-site/) to learn more about me and some of the projects I've done! 

And feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabrina-templeton/)!
